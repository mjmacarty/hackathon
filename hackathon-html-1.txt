The whole internet is mostly based on ten html tags:
<h1> - </h6>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<li></li>
<b></b> | <strong></strong>
<i></i> | <em></em>
<a></a>
<div></div>
<span></span>
<br>
<hr> 

Ok, so that's 11 but 10 sounds better!

Styles
background, color, images
font-families
font-size
font-weight
identifying elements with class and id


Javascript
HTML is static --> it doesn't "do" anything. JavaScript does stuff to HTML.
JavaScript "happens" with an HTML tag --> <script></script> 
You may see some examples with a "type" attribute (text/javascript), but this is not needed or expected in HTML5
