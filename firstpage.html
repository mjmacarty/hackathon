 <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
 <section>
 <h1>A content heading in my first page</h1>
 	<p>Headings are a lot of fun, and so are paragraphs. Pretty much every page out there must have a heading or a paragraph, or both. Life online just wouldn't be the same without these two workhorses.</p>
 	<p>As you can see from these two &lt;h1&gt; tags, text can be formatted differently based on where it is in the document hierachy.   However you can use h1-h6 within one section of a web page to get the same effect.</p>

 <hr style="border-width:1px; border-style:solid; color:#4775FF;">

 	<h1>Another exciting section of content</h1>
 	<p>See that line right about this section? That's the old "horizontal rule" tag.  In HTML5 it represents a "thematic break" in the page content. Shhh! Don't tell anyone. This isn't really a thematic break.  We can use &lt;br&gt; to add line breaks to the page which helps space things. Both of the se tags are examples of one-sided or empty tags. There are just a few of them but they are useful. Pictures go in the one-sided img tag.</p>

 	<h1>Adding some style</h1>
 	<p>All HTML elements have default style. For example the hr tag by default is centered and is 1 pixel thick, and it may be hard to see but it is "inset". By adding our own custom styles we can make things look different than the defaults.</p>
 	<p> Formally these styles are known as CSS (cascading style sheet), and there are three kinds. Here is a good place to use a list:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>inline - added as an attribute of a tag</li>
 		<li>embedded - in between &lt;style&gt; tags in the page header</li>
 		<li>linked - a separate file </li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>Note that the closer the instruction is to the HTML tag the higher the instructions priority, while the farther away the more general the instructions become. For website development, linked style is the most powerful since it allows the developer to apply consistent styles to all the pages in a website without repetitious coding.</p>

    <h1>What about images?</h1>
    <p>Here is a cool deep space image of the Super Magellanic Cloud galaxy.</p>

    <h1>Links!</h1>
    <p>The web wouldn't be much fun at all without links. They come in two varieties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="secondpage.html">Relative - links within your website</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://alphabench.com">Absolute - links to an external website</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Before we go...</h1>
    <p>Let's gain a little control over how our content is presented with some more style. We add a &lt;div&gt; element to hold the content. Then we do things like change the font, and center specific headings, and so forth.</p>
